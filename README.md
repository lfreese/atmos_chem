# Box Model

You can run the box model by clicking here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lfreese/atmos_chem/HEAD?filepath=Box_model_simple.ipynb), and change the parameters to fit what you are interested in! 

I'm still working out a few issues as far as time steps, and concentrations, so be mindful that your emissions and concentrations are within reasonable ranges of each other; that your box size is large enough; that your wind speed isn't too large; and that your timestep stays small (around 1 second). The more days you run it for, the longer it takes--I recommend starting with a few days first.
